# Introduction

The dataset that's used is the $CO_2$ dataset present in the `datasets`. The $CO_2$ data set basically contains data from a study from an experiment on the cold tolerance of grass plants. It records the rate of COâ‚‚ uptake (photosynthesis) by different plants by exposing varying concentrations of ambient $CO_2$, under different treatment conditions.

# Descriptive Statistics

```{r}

summaryTable <- CO2 |>
  group_by(Type, Treatment) |>
  summarise(
    Mean_Uptake = round(mean(uptake), 2),
    SD_Uptake = round(sd(uptake), 2),
    Count = n()
  )

kable(summaryTable, caption = "Mean Carbon Dioxide Uptake by Type and Treatment")
```

**Interpretation**

From the above table, we can see that there 21 plants in each group, and we observe the following

-    \textcolor{red}{Highest} $CO_2$ Absorption: **Quebec - Nonchilled plants**

-   \textcolor{blue}{Lowest} $CO_2$ Absorption: **Mississippi - Chilled plants**
