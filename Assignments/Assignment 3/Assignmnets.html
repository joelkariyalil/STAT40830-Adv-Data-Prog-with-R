This final project is based on all the material covered in the module.

Instructions

Create a Shiny app to read and summarise the Economic, Social, Environmental, Health, Education, Development and Energy data, and a short 1.5 minutes screencast to provide a brief overview of the App.

The Shiny app must allow for the following:

Allow the user to select data for at least one country given the countries names.

Change the title depending on the country/countries selected.

Display a table with part of the data. The user must be able to select the number of rows and the columns to be displayed.

Produce two different plots showing different information each. The user must be able to change at least 3 input in each plot.

The shiny app must have built-in data for at least 5 different countries.

The shiny app must allow the user to upload any extra Economic, Social, Environmental, Health, Education, Development and Energy dataset (indicators_COUNTRYCODE.csv) downloaded from data.humdata.org from any available county (You can assume that all files have the same structure).

Some notes:

Notice that you can re-use some code you created for Assignment 1 and/or Assignment 2, or create it from scratch.
You can use functions from any R packages.
Remember that in your Shiny app you must never have any file path specific to your computer.
Submission

Submission (submit on both platforms!):

on Posit Cloud - Assignment 3 RStudio Project (same class workspace as assignments 1 and 2).
Change your Project name into A3 12345678 where 12345678 is your student number. (Do not add any extra space or symbol in the project name)
Upload all the files needed to build the Shiny app (either R script or qmd files and the data), (Submissions where we cannot reproduce the Shiny app will be capped at 22.5 points (i.e. 50% of the final grade for Assignment 3))
on the Assignment 3 assessment on Brightspace:
a zip file containing the same material you’ve uploaded on Posit Cloud (i.e. all files to build Shiny app).
an mp4 file containing a 1.5 minutes video screencast showing how your Shiny app works (any video lasting more than 2.5 minutes won’t be checked). (You may want to use HandBrake to convert your file to mp4 or to reduce its size)
Note that only your final submission will be marked.

There are 45 marks for this assignment. This assignment is worth 45% of your final grade.

Late submissions will score 0.

How to get the data:

(Same as Assignment 1 and 2 - data for 5 countries needed this time!) For Assignment 3 you will have to download the dataset of the Economic, Social, Environmental, Health, Education, Development and Energy for five different countries of your choice from data.humdata.org/dataset/?q=Economic%2C+Social%2C+Environmental%2C+Health%2C+Education%2C+Development+and+Energy&sort=title_case_insensitive+asc&dataseries_name=World+Bank+-+Economic+Social+Environmental+Health+Education+Development+and+Energy:

Click over COUNTRYNAME - Economic, Social, Environmental, Health, Education, Development and Energy and download the dataset called Combined Indicators for COUNTRYNAME it will give you a .csv file called indicators_COUNTRYCODE.csv. (The dataset contains the following variables: Country Name, Country ISO3, Year, Indicator Name, Indicator Code, Value)

repeat this procedure for four other countries (total of five countries).

notice that some indicators may not be available for all countries.
